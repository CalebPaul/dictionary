##Dictionary
Create a program that allows users to create a dictionary to keep track of various words and their multiple definitions.

##Make two classes:
* One for Word
* One for Definition
* The homepage of the app should list all Words, and allow users to click a Word to view all its Definitions.
* A user should be able to add their own Word to the dictionary.
* When viewing a Word, users should also be able to add one or more unique Definitions.

##Objectives
Your project will be reviewed for the following objectives:

* An instance of one class appears in the method of another class (ie: Objects are successfully saved within other objects).
* Spark routes process GET and POST requests/responses successfully
* Spark routes follow RESTful conventions.
* All previous code review standards have been met (see below)
* If prompted, you are able to discuss the flow of your code and concepts behind it with an instructor using the correct terminology.
* Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
* Application works as expected.

##Previous Objectives
* Tests have complete coverage for all behaviors.
* All tests are formatted correctly and pass.
* Classes are encapsulated and getter methods are used to access properties.
* Logic is easy to understand.
* Build files are discluded from Git using a .gitignore file.
* Code and Git documentation follows best practices (descriptive variables names, proper indentation and spacing, separation between front and back-end logic, detailed commit messages in the correct tense, and a well-formatted README).
